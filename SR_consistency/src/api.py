prompt1_header = '''I will give you a transcription of a text about an enslaved native American. A human coder extracted information about an individual mentioned in the text into the data entries you can find below the transcription. \
                  Check if the extracted data can be found or inferred from somewhere in the transcription text. The text often mention multiple individuals, and thus there could be multiple bits of information that correctly fit the data field. Grade it correct if the human-coded data match any information mentioned. \
                  If the human coder left an entry empty or inputted NULL, trust their decision and keep it as it is (empty or NULL) in your output. Here is an example.\
